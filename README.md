# Introduction

Hi there and welcome to Mek's Math Game! A fun and simple console-based math game for all ages. This game includes the four basic math concepts of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. All answers are given in the form of an [integer](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/integer), yes even the division answers. For example: If you are given the math problem of 8 divided by 10, your answer would be 0.6 and some change, but the answer you would submit is simply 0 (zero). This program was created from [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/#) as a beginner style program for those (me) that are learning the [C# Programming Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/). This project is mean to be for pure fun and enjoyment.
